# Visualization-Of-Ensemble-Differential-Evolution-Algorithms

Evolutionary algorithms(EAs) are a powerful class of search algorithms used for optimization problems. They draw their inspiration from Dar- win’s Theory of evolution. They are generally used in case of NP hard problems as they don’t have either a polynomial time running algorithm nor a polynomial time check algorithm for the NP solution.
Since EAs are stochastic in nature, it is very difficult to analyze and understand their search dynamics. For instance, in the case of machine learning algorithms we can use visualisation plots to better understand how our models are performing. Same isn’t the case with evolutionary algorithms by virtue of their stochasticity. An even tougher task is to analyze the working of ensemble evolutionary algorithms. Simply put, ensemble learning clubs more than two algorithms together and suppos- edly gives us a better result than what those individual algorithms would have given us.
